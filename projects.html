        <h2>Projects Completed</h2>
        <p>Throughout my academic and personal learning journey, I have worked on several impactful projects that reflect my skills in software development, automation, and system design:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Network Automation Using Ansible</strong><br/>
                This project involved automating network device configurations using Ansible, an open-source automation tool. I developed playbooks to manage and configure network infrastructure efficiently, reducing manual errors and improving deployment speed. This experience deepened my understanding of network management, scripting, and infrastructure-as-code principles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Blood Donation System</strong><br/>
                I designed and developed a web-based Blood Donation Management System aimed at connecting donors with recipients and healthcare facilities. The system allows for donor registration, blood requests, and inventory tracking. I used PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL to build a functional and user-friendly platform that improves the efficiency and accessibility of blood donation services.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Graduation Certificate Authentication System</strong><br/>
                This project focused on developing a system for verifying academic certificates to prevent fraud and ensure authenticity. The solution uses secure technologies and a web interface to allow institutions and employers to validate certificates issued by educational bodies. It strengthens trust and transparency in academic credentials, and showcases my skills in system design, web development, and data security.
